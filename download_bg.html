		<dd>The table below shows 17 ESSTs and compares the number of structures and the functional residues masked from the alignments. There are four matrix types which differ in alignment source; OLD, ENZ, NOENZ and ALL.<br>
<br>
<b>OLD</b> is based on the 177 HOMSTRAD families, from which the ESST of Shi et al. [<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11419950?dopt=Citation'>3</a>] was derived.<br>
<b>ENZ</b> is for the 221 enzyme-specific SCOP families whose members contain at least one “ACT_SITE” residue or CSA hand-curated entry.<br>
<b>NOENZ</b> is the opposite of ENZ, which does not contain 'ACT_SITE' annotations and CSA entries at all.<br>
<b>ALL</b> is the 1187 final alignments obtained from the filtering process.<br>
<br>
Each matrix type is further divided into several subtypes (A, B, C and D) which differ in the masking sources of functional residues (see <a href="/ESST/gb_ESST.html#masking_source">this table</a>). This is to investigate the effect of a specific category of functional residues by comparing the differences in the substitution patterns.<br>
<br>
X is for non-masking and R is for random-masking. R is set as a control to see the significance of removing functional residues from the substitution models. The ESST of Shi et al. (OLD-J) [<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11419950?dopt=Citation'>3</a>] is based on 177 HOMSTRAD families which consist of 706 structures. It masks 2,048 resides which are involved in (1) interaction with heteroatoms and (2) domain-domain interaction. OLD-X and OLD-R is non-masking and random-masking model of J.<br>

      <h2><font size=4>New ESST</font></h2>
      <dl>
	<dd>We introduce how the calculation of ESSTs can be improved by discarding the functional residues from the calculation of substitution tables (Gong and Blundell, 2008 [<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18833291?dopt=Citation'>6</a>]).<br>
<br>
Four categories of functions are examined in this study (see the table <a href='/ESST/gb_ESST.html#masking_source'>below</a>):<br>
1) protein-protein interactions,<br>
2) protein-nucleic acid interactions,<br>
3) protein-ligand interactions,<br> 
4) catalytic activity of enzymes.<br> 
<br>
Their contributions to residue conservation are measured and investigated. We test our new ESSTs using a program CRESCENDO [<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15364576?dopt=Citation'>5</a>] designed to predict functional residues by exploiting knowledge of amino acid substitutions and compare the benchmark results with proteins whose functions have been defined experimentally.<br><br>
The new methodology increases the Z-score by 98% at the active site residues and finds 16% more active sites compared with the old ESST. We also find that discarding amino acids responsible for protein-protein interactions helps predicting those residues although they are not as conserved as the residues of active sites.<br><br>
Our methodology can make the substitution tables better reflect and describe the substitution patterns of amino acids which are under structural constraints only.

        <dd>The <b>Environment Specific Substitution Table or ESST</b> is a substitution table that considers structural constraints in the calculation of substitution patterns. Overington et al. [<a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1978340?dopt=Citation'>1</a>, <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1304904?dopt=Citation'>2</a>] first calculated ESSTs from a set of homologous protein families whose three-dimensional structures were available. The rationale behind ESSTs is that the acceptance of substitution of an amino acid in an orthologous family is subject to its local tertiary environment.<br>
<br>
		The local structural environments of amino acids include<br>
		1) main-chain conformation and secondary structure,<br>
		2) solvent accessibility, and<br>
		3) hydrogen bonding between side-chain and main-chain.<br>
		<br>
		One ESST consitsts of <b>64</b> substitution tables derived from a combination of structural features; <b>four</b> from secondary structures (α-helix, β-strand, coil and residue with positive φ main-chain torsion angle), <b>two</b> from solvent accessibility (accessible and inaccessible), and <b>eight</b> (2<sup>3</sup>) from hydrogen bonds to main-chain carbonyl or amide or to another side-chain.<br>
		These combinations of structural features restrict possible substitutions of an amino acid and give rise to distinct patterns of substitution.
